Explained with a cylinder example.  
Imagine the cylinder is hollow.  
The inner radius = distance to the cylinder wall from the center line.   
The outer radius = distance from center to the outside wall (edge).  
The radius to the point in the wall is equal to the inner radius + distance internal in the wall.  
Note this calc. assumes a thick walled cylinder.  
The internal pressure is the pressure inside the cylinder.  
The external pressure is the pressure outside the cylinder (usually, atmospheric pressure).
