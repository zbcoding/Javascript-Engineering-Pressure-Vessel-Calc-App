Explained with a cylinder example.  
Imagine the cylinder is hollow.  
The inner radius = distance from center line to the internal cylinder wall.   
The outer radius = distance from center to the outside wall (edge).  
The radius to the point in the wall = inner radius + small distance to the point inside the wall.  
The internal pressure is the pressure inside the cylinder.  
The external pressure is the pressure outside the cylinder (usually, atmospheric pressure).  
Note this calc. assumes a thick walled cylinder.
